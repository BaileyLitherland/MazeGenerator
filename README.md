This is a small Java program that generates a maze that is nxm given by the users. Every 2 points have a single unique path between them. Given any two points(right click and left click), the program can solve the maze.

It is currently a work in progress but it seeks to demonstrate my Java abilities and OOP skills.

TODO:

Change the adjaceny matrix to only store each vertex possible neighbours. This would make the matrix nx4 not nxm where n is the larger of n and m

Give the option for more sparse mazes with more than one solution

Give the option for the maze solving algorithm

Show the time it takes to generate and solve each maze
